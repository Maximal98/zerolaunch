# zerolaunch
Zerolaunch is a Program to bootstrap minecraft into a single .jar file.
Code + Assets are sourced from already installed Multi/Poly/Prism launcher instances.

its like 70% of the way there now, loader and assets are fully implemented on top of the base jar dependency merging.
only thing left to do is add automagic native support gui progress bars for the extraction progress


oh and make the bootstrapper GUI-Based maybe
